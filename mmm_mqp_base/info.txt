Launch commands
    Abb arm hooked up with the specifications below
        roslaunch mmm_mqp_base main.launch sim:=false
    Abb not connected
        roslaunch mmm_mqp_base main.launch sim:=true
    Test to see if the realsense camera is working
        $ 
    Testing point cloud conversion with pcl package
        rosrun point_cloud_converter point_cloud_converter points2_in:=/camera/depth/color/points points_out:=/mmm_pointcloud_scan


Things that I have installed while trying to make this work:
    NEEDED ros melodic
    NEEDED ros industrial
    NEEDED ros abb drivers
    NEEDED ros abb experimental
    NEEDED ros realsense2_camera
    NEEDED ros realsense2_description

Also some of the junk I tried along the way
    install out code
    sudo apt install ros-melodic-pcl-ros
    sudo apt install pcl-tools
    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-laser-assembler ros-melodic-laser-geometry ros-melodic-rqt-controller-manager ros-melodic-ros-controllers ros-melodic-gazebo-ros ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-control ros-melodic-robot-state-publisher ros-melodic-ros-comm ros-melodic-gazebo-plugins

Connected Devices expected IPv4 Addresses:
    NAME            IPv4 Address
    Robot           192.168.100.100
    Main Computer   192.168.100.104
    Rpi             10.42.0.123

Errors that can happen and how to fix them:
- on the flex pendant if the robot doesn't move after clicking start make sure you are in the production window and then release the deadman switch and then press it again and restart the program without restarting the Program pointer
- If there is ever a "Socket Error" on the flex pendant to fix this you click ABB button (top left) -> Restart -> Warm Start
- if arm not the right size (no model so the joints shouldn't line up)
    first check for the abb_irb1600_6_145_support package and look at /urdf/irb1600_6_12_macro.xacro 
    edit the src/abb_experimental/abb_irb1600_support/urdf/irb1600_6_12_macro.xacro file to make the lengths right
- The path planning isn't working real robot isn't in the right spot
    in the robot_interface_download_irb1600_6_145 make sure J23_coupled is false
- The joint sender code would not close with ros
    make sure the tk.mainloop() code (which is blocking) is called last and there is a way to kill the gui (e.i. rospy.on_shutdown(lambda:tk.quit())) 
- The robot was ending execution of trajectories because they were taking too long
    in trajectory_execution.launch.xml in the abb_irb1600_6_145_support package changed (1.2 -> 4) <param name="trajectory_execution/allowed_execution_duration_scaling" value="4.0"/>
- The robot was going into a pose where the arm would crush the clay
    Changed the joint limits in the file src/abb_irb1600_6_145_support/urdf/irb1600_6_145_macro.xacro
