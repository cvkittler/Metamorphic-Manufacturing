Launch commands
    Abb arm hooked up with the specifications below
        roslaunch mmm_mqp_base main.launch sim:=false
    Abb not connected
        roslaunch mmm_mqp_base main.launch sim:=true
    Test to see if the realsense camera is working
        $ 
    Testing point cloud coversion with pcl package
        rosrun point_cloud_converter point_cloud_converter points2_in:=/camera/depth/color/points points_out:=/mmm_pointcloud_scan


Things that I habe installed while trying to make this work:
    NEEDED ros melodic
    NEEDED ros industial
    NEEDED ros abb drivers
    NEEDED ros abb experimental
    NEEDED ros realsense2_camera
    NEEDED ros realsense2_discription

    install out code

Connected Devices expected IPv4 Addresses:
    NAME            IPv4 Adress
    Robot           192.168.100.100

    Rpi             192.168.100.105

Errors that can happen and how to fix them:
- on the flex pendant if the robot doesnt move after clicking start make sure you are in the production windown and then release the deadmans switch and then press it again and restart the program without restarting the Program pointer
- If there is ever a "Socket Error" on the flex pendant to fix this you click ABB button (top left) -> Restart -> Warm Start
- if arm not the right size (no model so the joints shount line up)
    first check for the abb_irb1600_6_145_support package and look at /urdf/irb1600_6_12_macro.xacro 
    edit the src/abb_experimental/abb_irb1600_support/urdf/irb1600_6_12_macro.xacro file to make the legths right
- The path planning isn't working real robot isnt in the right spot
    in the robot_interface_download_irb1600_6_145 make sure J23_coupled is false
- The joint sender code would not close with ros
    make sure the tk.mainloop() code (which is blocking) is called last and there is a way to kill the gui (e.i. rospy.on_shutdown(lambda:tk.quit()))
